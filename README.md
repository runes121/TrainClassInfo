# TrainClassInfo
When given a class of British Rail Train, it returns a basic summary of that train out of a limited dictionary.

There is a very limited amount of train classes that the program has a dictionary of.

The summaries are generated by the Bing AI, so some summaries may contain minimal error.


This also provides a basic module that can allow you to use the information included within this python application inside of another project.
